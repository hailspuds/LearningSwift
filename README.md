# I'm trying to learn Swift

I've done a far bit of PHP over the years, but it's time to learn something new. 

Enter Swift.

It interests me for a range of reasons, but mainly because I think it's something that I could apply to my own needs.

There's been many times when I wish I had "an app for that", so why not learn how to build it myself?

My plan is to spend *at least* 20-30 minutes a day on Swift. In many cases, it'll be longer than that, but that's the minimum. GitHub's commit streak recording will hopefully keep me on track.

There's no real structure to it. Just plod along through it all until I get a better handle of what to do, how and why.

I'll try to keep a list of useful resources here too, as I go. I do document them in my commits (and code) but probably easier if I keep them in the README too :)
